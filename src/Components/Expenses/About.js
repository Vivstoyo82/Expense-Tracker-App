                <h2>To provide access to world-class financial products to every Indian with a Smartphone
                    In a country of more than a billion people, only 10% are eligible for formal credit products. Our vision is to provide world-class financial products & services to those 90% of the underserved Indians.
                    Weâ€™re making this possible through our AI powered proprietary models that predict risk more accurately than traditional models used in the industry, thus ensuring right credit solutions are provided to the right users in a simplified manner!
